The Agile Book
Tracking the history of the Agile movement from the founders to today's world of Agile

Today the world has gone Agile. If you want to improve just about anything then there is an Agile group or expert that will help you become Agile in your work and life. Walk into many organization that is building products with software and you'll find Scrum Masters or ScrumMasters along with Product Owners (never seen ProductOwners) with backlogs and burndowns fight for attention. Those that are not doing Scrum have branched out to the dizzing world of Kanban where everything is flowing and visible but they have given up on Scrum but not told anyone. Further up the organisation you may see scaled agile which has manage to tell teams how to work in sync perhaps to three month phases with just enough money to not actually finish anything. For those that have gone off reservation, have grown a beard, moved to a big city and refuse to use Jira are running DevOps without care or cander to the world outside of their continuous pipeline.

The reality for many organisations that are running agile the uplift they were expecting have not yet manifested themselves. The answer to not seeing improvements when using agile are the same as the bloodletters of the past medicine: do more; you are not being agile enough, throw off the constraints of the organisation then self-form into super-productive teams powered on the simple fuel of autonmny, purpose and mastery. The truth behind Agile is that it for some organisations Agile practices and cultures are very powerful. However these practices and cultures where around before a late weekend skiing trip in Snowbird one February in 2001 and many who haven't heard or Agile continue to operate

17 people turned up at Snowbird in Feb 2001 that went on to publish the Agile Manifesto for Software Development. This is the story on how they got there and why they were there.

The people that attended all had an interest in lighter, simpler ways of developing software within organizations. All had worked within organizations which had huge software and therefore product delays so they had come up with ways to make the development more effective. The meeting itself was called the Lightweight Methods Meeting *confirm* representing methods that were not widely used. The following methods were present: Adaptive Software Development (ASD), Extreme Programming (XP), Scrum, Feature Driven Development (FDD), Dynamic System Development Method (DSDM) along with attendees that hadn't created a method but where vocal is the world of needing better ways of developing software including testing and Model Driven Development. All these methods would be classified as Agile methods after the meeting.

Scaling Agile - the fight to kill Agile

DevOps - XP is back but don't call it XP.
