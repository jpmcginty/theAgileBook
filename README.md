All the information and code for the Agile Book - History of Agile

# Welcome to theAgileBook where we look to clarify and publish the formation of the Agile methods
# As, hopefully, you would expect we are agile in the way that we do our work and when we say Agile we mean it as the Agile Manifesto signatories meant it all those years ago. Therefore our work is:
# 1. Free - if you want to use the information you can do so. All that we ask is that if you make a direct reference to either our work or of those that we reference you to provide that reference.
# 2. Open - we welcome comment and look for improvement. The knowledge that we have is just one view or intepretation of the world and so appreciate constructive conversation to make our work better. We are better as an open collective.
# 3. Tested - the work we publish will be of a tested standard. We aim to provide a trusted source of information with the appropriate permissions. Commentary of an event will be made clear to avoid you taking our word for the truth.
#
# That's it. Enjoy and looks to make the world a better, stronger place.
